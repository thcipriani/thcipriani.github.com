        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>

          I used a switch case - the same code I used in my detect keypress task. I'm wondering if that was the correct
          method of implementation - changing directions isn't too quick or responsive.

        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>
          I wasn't quite sure if this is what we're were trying to achieve - intially I had the jQuery animate() function as
          part of the mousemove event handler - which was an effect I actually liked a little better; however, the task
          instructions specifically advised against this and asked that you use and external function that is repeatedly called - setinterval
          is the appropriate function in this case.

          Fairly happy with the overall movement - not sure if I should have done a background object - I might has well've.

        <h4>Overview</h4>

          <p>

            My final game will have very little in the way of animated sprites, so I decided to have a little fun with this weeks exercise.

            I started with the example code and a sprite from <a href="http://nes-snes-sprites.com/" target="_blank">NES/SNES Sprites.com</a>.

            Overall I'm pretty proud of what I built - think it's neat. 'nuff said.
